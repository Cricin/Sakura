Sakura fallen wallpaper

this is my favorite live wallpaper, but it has poorly support about high resolution for modern android devices, for example, it is not capable with my MI 6X, so i decompiled and deobfuscated it(not all) fixed some compatibility problem.

* fixed a large black area at bottom of screen
* use ARGB888 instead of RGB565 to fix holo effect about background
* parallel scrolling is disabled for performance reason(nonfluent in my MI 6X when scrolling launcher)
* fixed crash about opening settings
* mountain position is dynamic computed(original is hardcoded in application)
* moon position is hardcoded now for performance reason, x position is 0.4 * screenWidth
* right branch of sakura position is dynamic computed by screenWidth

Note: this app not belongs to me, it belongs xllusion.com, if this repo tort with your copyright, i will delete it asap
